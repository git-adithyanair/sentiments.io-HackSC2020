Neg,"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
Neg,@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
Neg,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
Neg,@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
Neg,"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
Neg,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
Neg,@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
Neg,=@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet

Neg,"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
Neg,@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
Neg,@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
Neg,"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
Pos,=@united Terrific. many Thanks. looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. had a great flight up to Vancouver.
Neg,@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated‚Äîmy time wasted (2/2)
Neg,"@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"
Pos,@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
Neg,@united That's correct‚ÄîI've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
Neg,@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
Neg,@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
Neg,@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
Neg,@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.

Neg,@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns

Neg,@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.

Neg,@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
Neg,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
Neg,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
Neg,@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
Pos,=@united I wanna be Grand staff
Neg,"=@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
Neg,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
Neg,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
Neg,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
Pos,=@united I wanna be ride united airline!I love airplane
Neg,"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"

Neg,"@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ"
Neg,"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don‚Äôt see that it has taken off yet"
Neg,@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
Neg,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
Neg,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
Neg,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
Neg,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
Neutral,"@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty"
Neg,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
Neg,=@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it Sat at the Gate until '/Users/adithyanair/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Excel/Data/Documents/9:05'!Your employees totally suck.
Neg,"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
Neg,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
Neg,@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
Neg,"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
Neg,@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
Neg,=@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
Neg,"=@united even After running to Gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not Let US in the plane that was just parked. stranded"
Neg,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
Neg,"=@united nope, no more chances. your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
Neg,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
Pos,@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
Neg,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
Neg,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
Neg,@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
Pos,@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
Neg,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
Neg,"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
Neg,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
Neg,@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
Neg,"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
Neg,=@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
Neg,=@united customer service is the worst. hanging up on customers intentionally After one hour on hold.
Neg,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
Neg,"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
Neg,"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
Neg,=@united it will be on a different airline.
Neg,=@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
Neg,"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"

Neutral,@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
Neg,"=@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately I was just bounced around."

Neg,@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
Neg,=@united is there nothing you can do for me? no compensation at all? given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
Neg,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
Neg,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
Neg,=@united you Really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San francisco. poor communication bad help in getting connections
Neg,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
Neg,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay

Neg,@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
Neg,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.

Neg,"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"

Neg,=@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain What happened?
Neg,@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
Neg,@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
Neg,=@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. if it was weather I would understand

Neg,=@united give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.

Neutral,@united Flight 1547 CMH to ORD just arrived at gate. Next segment to YVR already boarding. Will they hold it?
Neg,"@united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?"

Neg,"@united : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks"
Neg,@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
Neg,@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
Neg,@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
Neg,@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
Neg,@united fuck you for not caring üò¢

Neutral,"=@united After all I have been through on this trip, can you get me on another airline home?"
Neg,=@united flight was Cancelled Flighted After the last opportunity to rebook US on other flights this evening passed.
Neg,@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
Neg,"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."

Neg,"@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent."

Neutral,"@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed."

Neutral,=@jetblue ID appreciate that. would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
Neutral,"@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, &amp; who's with who, &amp; who wins what. We're nice like that. ;)"

Neg,@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying

Neg,@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
Neg,@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue

Pos,"@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!"

Neg,"@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail"

Neg,=@USAirways Worst customer service experience ever today. get it together.
Neg,@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
Neg,@USAirways im on the plane not sure what you mean. We are sitting here. It's just one story of failure after another when I fly you guys
Neg,@USAirways still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory
Neg,@USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out.
Neg,=@USAirways them and @AmericanAir
Neg,@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
Neg,=@USAirways @AmericanAir terminal E in Miami is still the Worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing.

Neg,@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
Neg,@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
Neg,@USAirways it's not misjudging it's a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers
Neg,@USAirways - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week.
Neg,@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
Neg,@USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
Neg,=@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of Sad company.
Neg,@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
Neg,"@USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered"
Neg,"@USAirways yep, check it and my gmail 'Promotions' folder regularly... :-("
Neutral,@USAirways  is a bag that is   23‚ÄùL x 9‚ÄùW x 12‚ÄùH  allowed as a carry on?
Neg,=@USAirways Thanks for nothing

Neg,@USAirways 2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let's hope this plane works. I'm tired.
Neg,"@USAirways Good info, but am already signed up for all options.  None of which sound like they applied to the 'missing' emails."
Neg,=@USAirways is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia SC than making me stay in CLT over night After my delayed flight?

Neg,"@USAirways it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. ""Please wait"" then same form."

Neg,"@USAirways I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, &amp; it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed"
Neg,=@USAirways merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? all I get is a computer.
Neg,@USAirways #2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door!
Neg,"@USAirways and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what?"

Neutral,=@USAirways how can I get ahold of a reservations supervisor?

Neg,=@USAirways What is the damn delay????
Neg,=@USAirways it would be Nice to just pull up to the gate. still sitting here

Neg,@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
Neg,"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
Neg,.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
Neg,"@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"
Neg,"@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!"
Neg,"@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service"
Neg,=@USAirways why would you not give US the option to get off the plane Instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the Gate
Neg,@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
Pos,=@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
Neg,@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
Neg,=@USAirways Well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
Neg,=@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I AM traveling to get work Done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
Neg,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
Neg,=@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. a trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. ridiculous
Neg,=@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
Neg,@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
Neutral,@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ‚õÑÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è
Neg,@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.

Neg,@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
Neg,@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.

Neg,@USAirways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!!
Pos,=@USAirways Thank you for refunding me on my baggage !really appreciate it
Neg,@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
Pos,=@USAirways @AmericanAir I AM So going to miss US Airways.  you ALWAYS provided great service and never Let me down.
Neg,@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
Neg,.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
Neg,"@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
Neg,@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
Neg,@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
Neg,"@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical."
Neg,"@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service."
Neutral,=@USAirways mobile boarding pass email.
Pos,=@USAirways we will...sunday!Just a few days away
Neutral,=@USAirways I AM following you now
Neg,@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
Neg,@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
Neg,=@USAirways then told to offload because the captain was over hours? this has been a terrible experience.
Neg,"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"
Neg,=@USAirways why load US on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? unacceptable.
Neg,@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
Pos,"‚Äú@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?‚Äù Spring Break !!!"
Neutral,@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?
Neg,@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
Pos,@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. üëå
Neg,=@USAirways that seems unlikely Without a crew here to board US
Neg,"@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice"
Pos,@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
Neutral,@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
Neg,"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
Neg,@USAirways I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
Neg,@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
Neg,@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys‚Ä¶see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
Neg,=@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
Neg,"@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!"
Neg,"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
Neg,@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
Neg,@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
Neg,=@USAirways we Already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic Or will fly US home early complimentary.
Neg,@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
Neg,"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"
Neg,"@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!"
Neg,"@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you."
Neg,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
Neg,@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
Neg,@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
Neg,=@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
Neg,"@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta"
Neg,"@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection‚Ä¶ Help!"
Neg,@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
Neg,@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
Neg,@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
Neg,"@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment."
Neg,@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
Neg,@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
Neg,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
Neg,@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
Neg,"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
Neg,"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
Neg,"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
Neutral,"@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?"
Neg,"=@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing US to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded."
Pos,@USAirways FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team!

Neg,"=@USAirways I Already have, four times"
Neg,"@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed."
Neg,@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
Pos,"@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman"
Neg,"@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer"

Neg,"=@USAirways seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to Man UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF"
Neg,@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway

Neg,"@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!"
Neg,"@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded."
Neg,"@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say ""in progress"" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th."
Neutral,=@USAirways @AskPayPal So I contacted my bank. they took the money out today. I also contacted @USAirways they said my reservation is

Neg,@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.

Neg,@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
Neg,=@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? one way to try and mask a delay.

Neg,"@USAirways Your software is broken. ""Call Customer Support"" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers."
Neg,@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
Neutral,"=@USAirways is there nothing that can be Done online to Help? I bought these as a birthday present, just trying to be able to afford a change"

Neg,"@AmericanAir on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane, now the lines are frozen."
Neg,=@AmericanAir So disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys
Pos,=@AmericanAir Thanks
Neg,"@AmericanAir You found my lost luggage, won't bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn't nicer. Terrible service"
Neg,@AmericanAir Would it be ok to send you a DM asking a few questions because i'm deaf and been on hold so long?
Neg,"@AmericanAir ""sorry you were disappointed"" #outoftouchwithreality #people have kids and jobs"
Neg,@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 It's not allowing me to book available seats
Neg,"@AmericanAir seriously, all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids."

Neg,=@AmericanAir we have posted your response on Facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
Neg,@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
Neg,@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
Neg,"@AmericanAir If it's in my backpack, why do I need to see agent?"
Neg,@AmericanAir I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
Neg,@AmericanAir she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.

Pos,"@AmericanAir thanks.  I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed.  Guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/XGgCNTco8m"
Neg,@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.

Neg,=@AmericanAir Im still on hold...

Neg,"=@AmericanAir would you like Any additional details of my issue? airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?"
Neg,@AmericanAir 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.
